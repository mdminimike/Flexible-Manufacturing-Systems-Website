		<h1>Why Flexible?</h1>
		<p>The reason why this system is called flexible is that it the system is capable of processing a wide variety of part styles, also quantities of production can be altered in response to the ever-changing demand patterns of consumers. This makes the system quite versatile. When talking about flexibility, we see that it applies both to manual and automated systems.
In Flexible Manufacturing Production Lines, a mid-volume and mid-variety production is mostly common. Apart from that an FMS can produce a single part family or a limited range of part families.
Now a single part family would be a group of parts which possess similar geometric shapes and dimensions. By same reasoning a limited range of part families would imply in being able to produce a limited number of groups containing such parts.
The main applications for a Flexible Manufacturing System would be as follows:
		<p>•	Metal Cutting Machining</p>
		<p>•	Metal Forming</p>
		<p>•	Assembly</p>
		<p>•	Joining Welding</p>
		<p>•	Gluing</p>
		<p>•	Surface Treatment</p> 
		<p>•	Inspection</p>
		<p>•	Testing</p>

	The most common application from the mentioned above would be Flexible Machining Systems. By making use of, Computer Numerical Control, also known as CNC machines one can benefit from several capabilities. More over one can connect several CNC machine tools to a small central computer while also planning accordingly automated material handling systems to transfer parts from one machine to the other.

		<h1>Advantages</h1>
    	<p>The utilization and implementation of Flexible manufacturing systems has many potential benefits. These assets have been studied by numerous researchers. 
Such a system allows for customization and reconfiguration of certain products with minimal downtime and most importantly at low costs. Therefore, it allows companies to change and adapt its products to meet the needs of customers while being efficient and producing high quality products. Apart from that such system increases its productivity and leaves less room for inefficiency and material waste.
Apart from that such system, benefits from a reduction of workers. This would benefit the company a reduction in labor costs. Also, by reducing the number of duties that the workers must be concerned about, one would also decrease the human error, providing a more efficient and a quality product.
Also, the implementation of a Flexible Manufacturing System, reduces the inventory requirements. This is due to a continuous production of products rather than batch production.
Finally, the utilization of such machinery gives you the opportunity to operate the system 24 hours which will maximize profits. Apart from that such system can carry out operations such as tool and pallet changing automatically.</p>
   		<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
   		<p>On the other hand, there are also downsides with regards to a Flexible Manufacturing System. First of all, careful and substantial planning is required to implement such system. Such production planning is composed of the following fundamental areas. 
These are:
	<p>•	Strategic Planning</p>
	<p>•	Tactical Planning</p>
	<p>•	Operational Planning</p>

Due to sophisticated machinery, highly skilled and experienced employees should be employed in order to prevent malfunction of machinery or even cause damage. Apart from that such machinery should also have employees of certain expertise in repairing and maintenance. Such requirements for the operation of machinery can be quite costly.
Finally, the implementation of a Flexible Manufacturing System is quite expensive. In fact, usually such system is most commonly found in companies that have large revenue where they can invest in such system. Moreover, to increase the systems flexibility, one needs to invest in more adaptable machinery which is also quite expensive.
